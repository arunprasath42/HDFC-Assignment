Please find the below two services and the operations that are allowed.
Product Service: provides information about the product like availability, price, category
Order service: provides information about the order like orderValue, dispatchDate,
orderStatus, prodQuantity
The user should be able to get the product catalogue and using that info should be able
to place an order.
Once the order is placed for a particular product, the product catalogue should be
updated accordingly.
(Max quantity of a particular product that can be ordered is 10)
If the order contains 3 premium different products, order value should be discounted by
10%
The Order service should be able to update the orderStatus for a particular order.
dispatchDate should be populated only when the orderStatus is &#39;Dispatched&#39;.

product category values: Premium/Regular/Budget
order status values: Placed/Dispatched/Completed/Cancelled

Ask:
Create a github repo with public access and share the code in the same.
Code should be modular, scalable and as production ready as possible.
The implementation should use a noSql persistence (for simplicity use in-memory map)
The request payload should be strictly of json type.
Feel free to decide the HTTP endpoints to be used.
